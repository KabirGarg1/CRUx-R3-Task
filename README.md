# CRUx-R3-Task
 I tried a Lot of things like more traps and all..not all of them worked properly so i didnt showed them in any levels but they are still there in prefabs..same is with scripts..I coded a lot to try different stuff but not all were used.


1: Added Main Menu
2:Added more levels
3:Added More power-ups including slow time.
4:Added more enemies..One shoots Fireball sprites instead of Bullet sprite.
5:Player shoots Fireball.Was not able to implement more weapons properly..So In the final submission I removed some of the portion which was not working properly.
6:Made an overlay,and added multiple animations and effects.
7:Added Boss fight.
